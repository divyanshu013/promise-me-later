# promise-me-later

A minimal, vanilla JS library to throttle/rate-limit fetch, API calls and other promise returning functions :recycle:

```bash
npm i promise-me-later
```

## When to use
When you need to limit any promise returning function call rate but still want each call to happen over time. For example, a good use case for this is to limit calling APIs from `fetch` in browser or `node-fetch` in node environment.

## Extending
This can be extending to any promise returning function

WIP - Basic tests passing, need to do some more tests...
